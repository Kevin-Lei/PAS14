    f.execute('findItemsAdvanced', tag('keywords', 'shoes'))        

    dom    = f.response_dom()
    mydict = f.response_dict()

    # shortcut to response data
    print f.v('itemSearchURL')

    # process the response via DOM
    items = dom.getElementsByTagName('item')

    for item in items:
